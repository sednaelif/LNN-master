class Bound(_AutoName):

    Used to restrict an inference to a particular specified bound.

    Parameters
    ----------
    LOWER
        Evaluation of the lower bound of the range, or minimum possible value that truth can take wihtin the given range

        Evaluation of the upper bound of the range, or maximum possible value that truth can take wihtin the given range

class Direction(_AutoName):
    r"""An enumeration for the direction of inference.

    Used to restrict an inference pass (of a particular node or the entire model) to a single pass of the specified direction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    DOWNWARD
        Evaluation of operands given the operator and the rest of the operands
    UPWARD
        Evaluation of the operator given the operands

class Fact(Enum):

    Parameters
    ----------
    CONTRADICTION
        A classical interpretation of a contradictory input. Contradictions arise by disagreement of two signal, most often coming from different directions (UPWARD+DOWNWARD). This can be interpreted as a disagreement between the data and the logic, or more appropriately - introducing data to a logic that violates soundness and thereby moves the model into worlds that are not consistent with the logic.
    FALSE
        Classically False inputs as represented by LNN bounds
    TRUE
        Classically True inputs as represented by LNN bounds
    UNKNOWN
        A classical interpretation of what would be an unknown input, this is represented by LNN bounds with complete uncertainty
