# IBM Neuro-Symbolic Badges

Neuro-symbolic is still in its infancy, eclipsed by many areas in deep learning that are gaining traction. Our team recognises that we cannot make a lasting impact in this area without your contribution. To this end, we've taken it on ourselves to accelerate your upskilling and bring you up to speed with our state-of-the-art approaches. We're developing free course content in an interactive environment, allowing you to learn-by-play, and see how the different tools in NSAI all come together.

The first step in this journey is to build up a high-level intuition as to why we and much of the academic community believes that NSAI lays the ground-work towards broad-AI systems. We've set up [annual workshops](https://ibm.github.io/neuro-symbolic-ai/events) to help grow the NSAI community and will be hosting summer-schools and events along the way. We encourage you to go through the recordings at your own pace and become familiar with the field at large. Keep in mind that many of the techniques presented have opportunities to be integrated with one another.

The second step is to go through the structured material and earn a few badges as you progress. The content on the following badges are currently available:

1. [Neuro-Symbolic AI Essentials](https://ibm.box.com/s/42l32h0uno2ndq5o9omb7hl17dddpjuk)

We also welcome contributions and extensions to the tutorial content. In true open-source spirit, it's only by leaning on one another that we can build machines that embed human qualities of learning and reasoning.
